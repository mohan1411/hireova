# Contributing to Hireova

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Hireova as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Git Workflow

We use [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for our branching strategy.

### Branches

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch (default branch for PRs)
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes for production
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches

### Creating a Feature

1. Create your feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   ```

3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request to `develop` branch

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `ci`: CI configuration changes

### Examples
```bash
feat(auth): add LinkedIn OAuth integration
fix(resume): correct PDF parsing error
docs(api): update authentication endpoints
```

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where possible
- Format with `ruff format`
- Lint with `ruff check`

```bash
# Format code
ruff format .

# Check linting
ruff check .
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Airbnb style guide
- Format with Prettier
- Lint with ESLint

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_auth.py
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```python
def test_user_registration_with_valid_data_creates_user():
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

## Pull Request Process
